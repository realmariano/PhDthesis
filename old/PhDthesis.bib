We fabricated such sample structures with low density and high mobility in which we could tune, through an external gate voltage, the carrier conduction from n-type to p-type, passing through an insulating regime. For thin quantum wells with well width d \&lt; 6.3 nanometers, the insulating regime showed the conventional behavior of vanishingly small conductance at low temperature. However, for thicker quantum wells (d \&gt; 6.3 nanometers), the nominally insulating regime showed a plateau of residual conductance close to 2e2/h, where e is the electron charge and h is Planck{\textquoteright}s constant. The residual conductance was independent of the sample width, indicating that it is caused by edge states. Furthermore, the residual conductance was destroyed by a small external magnetic field. The quantum phase transition at the critical thickness, d = 6.3 nanometers, was also independently determined from the magnetic field{\textendash}induced insulator-to-metal transition. These observations provide experimental evidence of the quantum spin Hall effect.},

However, edge channels have so far only been demonstrated to occur in the quantum Hall regime, at high magnetic fields. We found that mercury telluride quantum wells in the quantum spin Hall regime exhibit nonlocal edge channel transport at zero external magnetic field. The data confirm that the quantum transport through the (helical) edge channels is dissipationless and that the contacts lead to equilibration between the counterpropagating spin states at the edge. The experimental data agree quantitatively with the theory of the quantum spin Hall effect. The edge channel transport paves the way for a new generation of spintronic devices for low-power information processing.},

  abstract  = {An electron-cooling principle based on Landau quantization is proposed for nanoscale conductor systems. Operation relies on energy-selective electron tunnelling into a two-dimensional electron gas in quantizing magnetic fields. This quantum refrigerator provides significant cooling power (âŒ10â9âW at a few kelvin for realistic parameters) and offers a unique flexibility thanks to its tunability via the magnetic-field intensity. The available performance is only marginally affected by nonidealities such as disorder or imperfections in the semiconductor. Methods for the implementation of this system and its characterization are discussed.},

  title    = {Manetoresistance of Ultralow-Hole-Density Monolayer Epitaxial Graphene Grown on SiC},
  abstract = {Silicon carbide (SiC) has already found useful applications in high-power electronic devices and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Interestingly, SiC is a suitable substrate for growing monolayer epitaxial graphene and GaN-based devices. Therefore, it provides the opportunity for integration of high-power devices, LEDs, atomically thin electronics, and high-frequency devices, all of which can be prepared on the same SiC substrate. In this paper, we concentrate on detailed measurements on ultralow-density p-type monolayer epitaxial graphene, which has yet to be extensively studied. The measured resistivity xx shows insulating behavior in the sense that xx decreases with increasing temperature T over a wide range of T (1.5 K  T  300 K). The crossover from negative magnetoresistivity (MR) to positive magnetoresistivity at T = 40 K in the low-field regime is ascribed to a transition from low-T quantum transport to high-T classical transport. For T  120 K, the measured positive MR ratio [xx(B) - xx(B = 0)]/xx(B = 0) at B = 2 T decreases with increasing T, but the positive MR persists up to room temperature. Our experimental results suggest that the large MR ratio (~100% at B = 9 T) is an intrinsic property of ultralow-charge-density graphene, regardless of the carrier type. This effect may find applications in magnetic sensors and magnetoresistance devices.},

review the key experimental breakthroughs that have triggered the recent growing interest into phase-
coherent heat transport. They include the realization of thermal interferometers, diffractors, modulators
and routers based on superconducting tunnel junctions. Finally, we discuss very recent theoretical find-
ings based on superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor (S-TI-S) Josephson junctions that show
interesting heat transport properties due to the interplay between topological band structures and super-
conductivity.},

A significant portion of attention in FQHE has been dedicated to filling factor 5/2 state, for its unusual even denominator and possible application in topological quantum computation. Traditionally, FQHE has been observed in high-mobility GaAs heterostructure, but newmaterials such as graphene also open up a new area for FQHE.This review focuses on recent progress of FQHE at 5/2 state and FQHE in graphene.},

As quantummechanics is important Entropy production for most such machines, they fall into the field of quantum thermodynamics. In many Second law of thermodynamics cases, the machines we consider have few degrees of freedom, however the reservoirs Quantum transport of heat and work that they interact with are assumed to be macroscopic.

Interestingly, SiC is a suitable substrate for growing monolayer epitaxial graphene and GaN-based devices. Therefore, it provides the opportunity for integration of high-power devices, LEDs, atomically thin electronics, and high-frequency devices, all of which can be prepared on the same SiC substrate. In this paper, we concentrate on detailed measurements on ultralow-density p-type monolayer epitaxial graphene, which has yet to be extensively studied. The measured resistivity xx shows insulating behavior in the sense that xx decreases with increasing temperature T over a wide range of T (1.5 K  T  300 K). The crossover from negative magnetoresistivity (MR) to positive magnetoresistivity at T = 40 K in the low-field regime is ascribed to a transition from low-T quantum transport to high-T classical transport. For T  120 K, the measured positive MR ratio [xx(B) - xx(B = 0)]/xx(B = 0) at B = 2 T decreases with increasing T, but the positive MR persists up to room temperature. Our experimental results suggest that the large MR ratio (~100% at B = 9 T) is an intrinsic property of ultralow-charge-density graphene, regardless of the carrier type.

  abstract = {The quantum Hall (QH) effect, a topologically non-trivial quantum phase,
expanded and brought into focus the concept of topological order in physics. The 
topologically protected quantum Hall edge states are of crucial importance to the QH effect 
but have been measured with limited success. The QH edge states in graphene take on an 
even richer role as graphene is distinguished by its four-fold degenerate zero energy 
Landau level (zLL), where the symmetry is broken by electron interactions on top of 
lattice-scale potentials but has eluded spatial measurements. In this report, we map the 
quantum Hall broken-symmetry edge states comprising the graphene zLL at integer filling 
factors of 𝝂𝝂 = 𝟎𝟎, ±𝟏𝟏 across the quantum Hall edge boundary using atomic force 
microscopy (AFM). Measurements of the chemical potential resolve the energies of the 
four-fold degenerate zLL as a function of magnetic field and show the interplay of the 
moiré superlattice potential of the graphene/boron nitride system and spin/valley 
symmetry-breaking effects in large magnetic fields. 
 
The integer QH effect results when a 2-dimensional (2D) electron system is subjected to a 
perpendicular magnetic field (1–3). The metrological precision of the Hall conductance is 
understood in terms of the topological invariant of the Chern number associated with the Berry 
connection (4–7). The precise quantization of the Hall conductance is related to the absence of 
backscattering in topologically protected chiral one-dimensional edge states with different},

@Thesis{asmanPhD,
  abstract = {This research develops a theoretical model to explain the behaviour of the thermo-power in the quantum Hall regime. It uses the concept that at low temperatures the transport through the system will be caused by thermal activation as well as that caused by the conductance. The model is built up in stages, starting with proving the assumption that Dykhne's theorem will work for an asymmetric distribution of particle transport through the system and deriving the behaviour of the particles in the edge states of the system. It then combines this information with a previously developed simple model for the bulk of the modulation-doped GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure and compares this with experimental data. This reveals that this simple system is not a viable model to represent the data, and as such the model is made more complex with the inclusion of tunnelling. The different parameters which describe the model are found, the saddle energy gap , the transition value for the edge states c, the current splitting parameter and the tunnelling parameter . This is done either by extracting them from the experimental data, or in the case of considering it as a free parameter. How these values vary with the temperature is investigated before a comparison of the theoretical model including tunnelling is conducted with the experimental data. The result from the comparison show a promising alignment between the model and experiment, and further work is proposed where is no longer considered a constant.},
