%%%% chapters (mainmatter)

% You can use \input or \include. 
% \input will include the .tex right into the file like it was text in that position, i.e. you can even use it in the preface.
% \include will add a page break before and after the .tex. Also, will let you use \icludeonly{file} (see https://latexref.xyz/_005cinclude-_0026-_005cincludeonly.html) in the preamble, that becomes useful when writing your thesis to only compile a particular chapter. But you can not use it in the preface.
