\emph{A conclusion...}

\textcolor{blue}{INcluir una discusi√≥n sobre el Vtp}

The measurements show that there are two outputs, an in-phase resistive (ip) and out-of-phase (op) components. They are not shown in previous works (CHECK THIS!). Initial calculations taking into account an original idea of Dr. Arrachea, taking a capacitive effect into the edge-channels, comming from a redistribution of charge might help to understand them.

Resulting in contributions of the form
\begin{align}
    \vtpout &= \frac{\capac \omega T}{\left(\capac \omega T \right)^2 + \onsa{11}^2} \left(  \onsa{12} - \onsa{11} \Delta T \right)\\
    %
    \vtpin &= \frac{-1}{\left( \capac \omega T \right)^2 + \onsa{11}^2} \left(  \onsa{11} \onsa{12} + \left( \capac \omega T \right)^2 \mathcal{D} \right) \Delta T \\
    %
    \mathcal{D} &= \frac{\mathcal{D}^{\mu}}{\mathcal{D}^{T}}
\end{align}

CHECK D DEFINITION AND INCLUDE ITS RELATION TO DENSITIES, ALSO INCLUDE THE DEFINITION OF C, THAT DEPENDS ON SEVERAL OTHER CAPACITANCES.
